 * creates a child session of this session, which offers more APIs:
 *
 * * To create a new page/tab, use [BrowserSession.newPage] and then interact with it through the returned
 * [PageSession], which is a child session of the browser session and has many more APIs.
 *
 * * If you want to attach to an already existing target, use the [BrowserSession.target] domain to get information
 * about the target, and then use [BrowserSession.attachToTarget]. Note that you will only get a plain [ChildSession]
 * after this. Use one of the converters to convert this session to the proper type depending on the target type you
 * want to interact with. For example, if you're attaching to a worker, use [ChildSession.asWorkerSession] to get a
 * [WorkerSession], which offers the relevant domains for you.
